[{"categories":["Tips/Tutorial"],"contents":"The solution to embed your Tableau Public Dashboard in Markdown files for your static site using simple shortcode\n● ● ●\nWhen first time I wrote about my visualization stories on blog, I had a problem on how to embed the Tableau Public dashboard in my website. Just for information, I built this website using Hugo static site generator. If you have never known what Hugo is, you can read from their website here. The documentations they provide are really complete and clear. They have cool themes for free or premium also! In my opinion, this is one of the easy and powerful platforms to create a blog or website.\nHugo natively supports Markdown and HTML for content markup. Therefore, my contents are created with Markdown as the writing method. If you are familiar with the R programming language, you should probably know this. The example of Markdown script writing can you see as shown below.\nWhen I tried to display a dashboard on my blog by only pasting dashboard embed code from Tableau Public in my Markdown file, it didn\u0026rsquo;t work. This is because the Hugo theme I am currently using does not yet support embedded link features other than Youtube, Instagram, Vimeo, and Twitter. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to replace my dashboard view by attaching screenshots or gifs only, because it is less interactive. So, I struggled and had to figure out how to solve this problem. I saw that some people also have same problem as me too in many forums. After googling here and there, I finally found the easy way like this tutorial, yay!\nSo, we can call this way as \u0026lsquo;Insert Raw HTML in Hugo by Writing Simple Shortcode\u0026rsquo;.\nOkay now, let\u0026rsquo;s get started!\n1. Add a shortcode template to your site First thing first, make the content in layouts/shortcodes/rawhtml.html like below:\n{{.Inner}} This template tells Hugo to simply render the inner content passed to your shortcode directly into the HTML of your site.\n2. Copy your Tableau dashboard embed link Now, open your Tableau dashboard and click Share icon. Copy the embed code like the screenshot below:\n3. Paste your embed code Next, you can use shortcode template by pasting your embed code into Markdown content by writing syntax:\n{{@\u0026lt; rawhtml \u0026gt;@}} (paste your dashboard embed link here) {{@\u0026lt; /rawhtml \u0026gt;@}} Note: Please delete '@'\nNow, save your file.\nVoila! Your dashboard is succesfully displayed now in your blog like so:\n var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1620224683342'); var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0]; if ( divElement.offsetWidth  800 ) { vizElement.style.width='1024px';vizElement.style.height='795px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth  500 ) { vizElement.style.width='800px';vizElement.style.height='830px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='1777px';} var scriptElement = document.createElement('script'); scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js'; vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);  In fact that\u0026rsquo;s so easy, right?\nAs default, the dashboard will be shown fully based on its original size in Tableau Public. But actually you can set or custom the size of your dasboard by changing it in vizElement.style part for its height and width, as simple as that! This probably could be applied to embed codes from other website too. To be honest I haven\u0026rsquo;t ever done that yet, but you can set it by using this method to know whether it works or not.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all a tip for today. If you have any question, feel free to reach me through one of my social media as shown above! I\u0026rsquo;ll be glad to help. Thanks for reading.\n","permalink":"https://gandesgold.com/blog/tableau-markdown/","tags":["Dashboard","Markdown","Tableau"],"title":"How to Embed Your Tableau Dashboard in Markdown"},{"categories":["Data Visualization"],"contents":"This is 2nd story about my data visualization journey development using Tableau, first weeks after I start to participate #MakeoverMonday community project\n● ● ●\nTo be honest, I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to share this experience with all of you, especially for Indonesian data enthusiasts fellow. At the beginning of the year I was very busy with new office projects, and at the same time I was on vacation in hometown (my office still manages work from home due to pandemic), so I just have a time to publish it today. This post is a continuance from Part 1, so for those who haven\u0026rsquo;t read it yet, you can check here.\n#dataviz community project? Since December 2020, I actually have plans to improve my data visualization skills in 2021, since I am really interested in this thing. But in fact, since my fourth dashboard was published, I haven\u0026rsquo;t started again. It feels like I dont have any energy or motivation at that time, so there is nothing new. I opened Tableau Public Gallery for inspiration, but to be honest I\u0026rsquo;m still lazy to do it. Until one day I opened my Twitter account and randomly looked for people tweets related to Tableau. At that time, the search results mostly used #datafam, #dataviz, and #MakeoverMonday hashtag. Okay, maybe I know that #datafam means data family, #dataviz means data visualization. But what is the #MakeoverMonday hashtag? Why do so many people seem to post their viz results with this hashtag and use the same dataset? After I checked, it turns out that #MakeoverMonday is one of the weekly global community project initiated by data visualization enthusiasts. We get a prepared dataset (tidy mostly) once a week and then start to make a viz/makeover the original chart generally starting on Monday. For more details, you can see on their website.\nI honestly felt attracted to it at the time, apparently there are cool initiatives like this out there. In Indonesia, I have never been involved in online projects like this before. I hardly ever met them. However, when I observed it, it seemed that active participant from Indonesia is still rare for this community. Maximally 1-3 people only maybe, I don\u0026rsquo;t know. Mostly people come from U.S., U.K., India, and other parts of the world. So guys, if you are interested in plunging into the world of data visualization, there is nothing wrong to enter this community. #MakeoverMonday projects are really good for newbie. I highly recommend it, really!\nWell, I thought, this will be one of my biggest motivations to keep learning data visualization. The people in community look very supportive and welcome when there are new participants. Some of them gave me follow back when I started to follow them. From here, I also began to understand about Tableau Zen Master, Tableau Public Ambassador, Tableau Public Featured Author, #VOTD a.k.a Viz of the Day and other community terms.\nStarting to share my work 2021 has been started already, and I have commitment to participate sending submission for #MakeoverMonday at least one or two each month to gain my skills. To be honest for the first weeks I was still shy and intimidated to share my work in public. In fact, when I watched some video talks with #datafam community on Youtube, many of them also feel the same! It feels like your work is still far from perfect and attractive. Well, being perfect is relative anyway. I know that if we always think so, we don\u0026rsquo;t grow. They said in some talks, that\u0026rsquo;s really okay whether you are a newbie or Zen Master already to publish your vizzes, everyone is still always learning and learning. If you don\u0026rsquo;t share, people wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recognize about your work!\nSo, after that I began to share my work on Twitter using hashtag above and yeah there are some people give comment, likes, or retweet sometimes. My viz for #MakeoverMonday Week 13 below has became the first viz I shared publicly on Twitter.\nFrom this community also I became understand how to make our viz more beautiful by using another tools like Figma, Adobe Illustrator, or even simple app like PowerPoint! Since I feel familiar enough using these app, it is easier for me to operate.\nBeside #MakeoverMonday, there are some exciting community project you can find to enhance your data analytics and visualization portfolio, such as:\n #TheSDGVizProject (SDG = Sustainable Development Goals) #SWDChallenge (SWD = Storytelling With Data) #ProjectHealthViz #IronQuest #Viz2Educate #DiversityInData #SportVizSunday #VizForSocialGood #DuBoisChallenge  So far, I still have ever joined 2 (#MakeoverMonday and #TheSDGVizProject). But it is possible that in the future I will contribute to other challenges. Actually, I\u0026rsquo;m quite interested in projects related to social impact. So, maybe #VizForSocialGood will be my next consideration.\nLearning resources for beginners If you are newbie and want to learn dataviz, actually there are so many free resources to learn! You can buy courses, training, or even by watching Youtube and reading #datafam blogs. There is something I really like about this community: Besides of solid community, they are so generous to share their knowledge. When you find difficulties or stuck in applying some techniques in Tableau, they are very welcome to teach. Many of them have great Youtube channel or blogs for tutorials. I often hear their acknowledgments that sharing knowledge is part of paying back to community. Many of them has got great impact, whether personally or profesionally.\nWell, since there are many good learning resources, I will recommend to you some from #datafam community. Please check them out:\n Andy Kriebel\u0026rsquo;s Youtube channel\nI really love his channel! This channel usually become my first destination when I stuck on certain techniques. He and his partner Eva Murray have released #MakeoverMonday book. Honestly, this is one of my favorite technical book all the time! By the way, Andy is a Tableau Zen Master. He is so well-known in community as leader of #MakeoverMonday initiative. He also has blog, you can check here. There is an advice I remember from him: Don\u0026rsquo;t delete your old vizzes even for the worst one, because you will be able to see your progress day by day. I definitely agree with this! I will applied same too with my blog to see my improvement in writing Anthony B. Smoak\u0026rsquo;s Youtube channel\nI learned making Covid-19 dashboard for the first time from his channel too. His explanation is clear enough. Beside Tableau, he also teach other BI tools Flerlage Twins Blog\nThe owner is a twin brothers (Ken and Kevin) who really mastered Tableau. Both of them are Zen Master Tableau Design Tips\nI love reading this blog, since it provides many tips about tableau, and understanding how a good dashboard should be Tableau Magic\nThe blog\u0026rsquo;s owner is famous among dataviz enthusiast too, and he is a Zen Master Playfair Data\nThis is also another cool website about Tableau I often visit! Data + Science\nOnce again, a cool blog from another Zen Master. Jeffrey also often share his Tableau tips on twitter Vizconnect\u0026rsquo;s Youtube Channel\nThis is channel for #datafam talks I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned before. Some cool tutorials about Tableau from #datafam are there to watch!  Well, before finding this community actually I am confused: How to combine my technical skill with art? At that time I was thinking about moving to Front End Programmer or UX/UI Designer. But I was not sure whether it is what I really want for my career or not. But now, my confusion has been answered. Data + Viz, learning how to deliver story with attractive visual from data is such cool combination. This is something I am willing to do, even for hours until I forget everything! (And it becomes my new hobby now)\n I wish I met this kind of community earlier! :CRYYY:  Yep, I thought of that everytime firstly. But that\u0026rsquo;s okay, since it\u0026rsquo;s never too late to learn!\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s all my little experience in dataviz journey. I am ready to learn something new everyday. Well, maybe I seem a little bit quiet or inactive on Twitter to engage. But believe me, all of #datafam people have became my great inspiration all the time!\nThanks for reading.\n","permalink":"https://gandesgold.com/blog/starting-dataviz-journey-part-2/","tags":["Tableau","dataviz"],"title":"Journey in #DataViz (Part 2)"},{"categories":["Data Visualization"],"contents":"The story behind the viz for #MakeoverMonday Week 17 submission. This is first time I implemented tile map in Tableau, finally!\n● ● ●\nAnother week of #MakeoverMonday challenge, check! This week we look at \u0026lsquo;Regional Price Parity Per State in the U.S\u0026rsquo;.\nWell, I am really interested with this topic. Why? Because as a non-American, I became to know about which state in the U.S has highest average price. Based on data, we know that Hawaii is the most expensive one in the country, following by East and West Coast states like New York, California, and New Jersey. For full article, you can check here.\nOriginal chart To be honest, eventhough the original radial chart style looks unique I couldn\u0026rsquo;t fully understand when I read it for the first time.\nWhat works well  The title has good size and font, at least for me. There is clear disclaimer about price for national average (US=100) As a fan of light color for dashboard, I love the white background so the chart could be shown clearly. Immediately we can see which states that have highest and lowest price in average.  What could be improved Personally like I have said before, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t understand enough when I read the original one especially for the circles parts, whether it is ordered by year or whatever. Using another simple chart like map or bar chart maybe could give better experience, in my opinion.\nWhat I did Seeing from sent submissions this week, I observed that there are so many similar hex maps/tile maps appeared! I don\u0026rsquo;t wonder about that. Tile map just popped into my head as I was seeing there is state column in the data. Tile map has been in my learning bucket list, actually. For this week\u0026rsquo;s submission I wanted to implement tile map, but the one which is inspired by Yuli Wang. She made a cool tile map for her submission about U.S. Presidential Election. You can check directly here.\nFortunately, she also provided the tutorial about how to make this visualization. Maybe it seems complicated a bit for a beginner, but still I want to give it a try! For complete tutorial, you can read further from Michael Sandberg\u0026rsquo;s dataviz blog.\nThe picture below shows how I created the tile map with bar chat and the background square. Adding price and state labels from each tile is such a tricky part I learned from Yuli.\nAfter tile map has done, now the next step is dashboard design, which is part I really love! I added some annotation with lines, inspired by cool vizzes I saw from Pinterest. I really love Pinterest to look for inspiration!\nFor background, I made it in Figma. I fell in love with this graphic design tool since I don\u0026rsquo;t need to install locally in my laptop like CorelDraw or Adobe Illustrator. I have basic skill in both, so it is not too difficult for me to use Figma for the first time. Thanks #datafam on Twitter who introduced me to this cool tool!\nTo see final result with a better view, please scroll and click full screen button in bottom right corner from the dashboard below!\n var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1620572647385'); var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0]; vizElement.style.width='800px';vizElement.style.height='1345px'; var scriptElement = document.createElement('script'); scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js'; vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);  Personally I feel satisfied enough for my own submission this week, since I have successfully executed Yuli\u0026rsquo;s tutorial eventhough there were some failures.\nFinally, we are in the end part of the post. Can\u0026rsquo;t wait to try the upcoming challenge from #datafam community, ayey!\nThanks for reading.\n","permalink":"https://gandesgold.com/blog/regional-price-parity/","tags":["Tableau","makeovermonday"],"title":"Regional Price Parity for Each State in the U.S — #MakeoverMonday"},{"categories":["Data Visualization"],"contents":"The story behind the viz for #MakeoverMonday Week 14 submission and got selected as my 1st Favorite Viz of the Week\n● ● ●\nThe 14th dataset for #MakeoverMonday 2021 was out already, and challenge of this week is making a better viz about \u0026lsquo;Multiclass Classification of Dry Beans\u0026rsquo;.\nOriginal chart From the scientific paper source we can see that the writer used multiple bar chart with some colors to differentiate the variety of the dry beans. Let\u0026rsquo;s have a look at the original visualization:\nWhat works well  The colour legend is in a prominent place and easy to understand (at least for me). Multiple bar chart style is good enough to explain the rate of classification. The white background makes the design simple and the bar chart is shown clearly.  What could be improved  There is no title to explain what chart it is about. The algorithm abbreviation would be useless for those who don\u0026rsquo;t understand about machine learning if they don\u0026rsquo;t read the full paper or only see for first sight. Using different color for the label of number would be useful for audience to quickly determine which algorithm has the highest classification rate. Trying to use the bean class as parameter and explain the features should be interesting to learn the characteristic of each beans.  Some people in community said that 14th week dataset is really challenging through their tweets, I definitely agree. Because I was too confused, I decided to watch Andy Kriebel\u0026rsquo;s #WatchMeViz in his Youtube to get some inspiration before jumping into analysis. You can check for the video here.\nWhat I did There were so many box plot, scatter plot, and even spider chart I saw from people\u0026rsquo;s submission to visualize data this week. But after watching Andy\u0026rsquo;s #WatchMeViz video, I decided to take inspiration from his chart which is focused on relative value of features from each beans. For the chart I wanted to try to use coxcomb style, as I want to learn something new also. Maybe it is a little bit different from other people\u0026rsquo;s submission, but that\u0026rsquo;s totally okay for me. Here is the simple bar chart to show relative value (size and %) of the features from each bean class like Andy has done.\nTo see the percentage of relative value for each class, first thing first I have to make the \u0026lsquo;Relative Value\u0026rsquo; calculation. And this is the example of its display as a table form.\nBecause making a coxcomb chart needs another chart template as data source, I had to make it first in Excel like below:\nAfter I try for a few hours, but I was still not be able to set my chart similarly like a proper coxcomb. It still forms like a propeller. I let it be for now since the result is almost similar like my first intention. It is possible that I will update it later after I find the solution :CRYYYY:\n By the way if you want to try coxcomb chart, please check the tutorial from Tableau Magic here to see further.\n Next for final process, I added a parameter as feature filter.\nOkay since the chart and parameter has done, the final step is designing dashboard and extracting the data. I want to make the style so simple and clean. So I only need to make a title, a brief summary, add a legend, and a calm color for the background (I think a light blue is a cool one).\nFinally, the result has appeared!\nCheck out below for interactive dashboard version! Please hover over the \u0026lsquo;colorful propeller\u0026rsquo; to see more details.\n var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1620485415892'); var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0]; if ( divElement.offsetWidth  800 ) { vizElement.style.width='900px';vizElement.style.height='1127px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth  500 ) { vizElement.style.width='900px';vizElement.style.height='1127px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='727px';} var scriptElement = document.createElement('script'); scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js'; vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);  Well, as beginner personally I am satisfied enough with the result eventhough I wasn\u0026rsquo;t be able to make it like a proper coxcomb chart in my inspiration resources. At least, the message I want to deliver to audience is sent by seeing the size and color of each bean class and of course, its tooltip!\nGot selected as one of #MakeoverMonday viz favorites of the week On sunday night suddenly I got a mention notification on Twitter from Eva Murray (co-lead of #MakeoverMonday), and she tagged me in her tweet. And here it is\u0026hellip;\nWell done everyone on a really challenging dataset for #MakeoverMonday this week.\nHere are our favorite visualizations...\nStay tuned for the #dogfavorites being posted below shortly.

I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect anything at all since there were so many cool submissions from great people. But, this recognition makes me even more excited to participate in upcoming challenges and make better works. Thanks #datafam!\nLesson learned Since this week challenge is a little bit difficult for me personally, I\u0026rsquo;ve tried hard to look for something different with the chart type. This quote is probably the best one to descript what I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced this week.\n \u0026quot;Dare to be different!\u0026quot;  Yup, this week challenge has given me time to reflect and encourage myself that it is okay to try different chart. Everyone has different perspective, so if you feel that it is best to explain the story, just implement that!\nOkay, that\u0026rsquo;s all story from today. I am ready to prepare for the next challenge. Hopefully this will give you an insight too!\nThanks for reading.\n","permalink":"https://gandesgold.com/blog/dry-beans-multiclass-classification/","tags":["Tableau","makeovermonday"],"title":"Multiclass Classification of Dry Beans — #MakeoverMonday"},{"categories":["Data Visualization"],"contents":"This is the story about how I started my passionate hobby for the first time in data visualization, particularly in using Tableau\n● ● ●\nIf you could see a Covid-19 dashboard picture in this post, I want to say that actually it is my first dashboard I built in Tableau Public. How did I start to enter in data visualization? I will share my experience here, today!\n2020 brings me there Well, 2020 has been a shocking year for most of the people. No one knows if in that year a big pandemic began to hit, almost all over the world. Nobody thought that schools and offices would be closed and restricted. Many students and workers are forced to do their activities at home. #StayAtHome became a very popular hashtag at that time since the first lockdown times.\nI admit that 2020 is a pretty tough year to pass for some people, including me. But I always try to think, that behind an incident there must be a lesson. Maybe if 2020 had not been a pandemic, I would not be able to deeply contemplate, know myself, and think about what I want to do in life. This may sound a little philosophical, but that\u0026rsquo;s what happened to me. So, regardless of what happened this year: Thanks 2020!\nAt the start of the lockdown in various countries, I started reading a lot of e-books I\u0026rsquo;ve downloaded on Kindle almost everyday because I was bored and confused about what to do. I also created a new bookstagram account, in collaboration with one of my colleagues at the time to share takeaways from the books we have read. By the way, for article related to how I started building a bookstagram and benefits I get, you can read here.\nAt the start of the pandemic I also saw on social media that there were lots of people sharing about courses or training that could be issued by online. Even popular course platforms like Coursera, EDX, DataChamp provide them for free. For people who love to learn, this must be very interesting info. Because I\u0026rsquo;m bored just reading and making posts about books on Instagram, I want to learn new things to improve my skill for work, since I really want to look for another good opportunities. Almost everyday I took part in free online training and courses about finance, self-awareness, and data science.\nOnly courses, is it enough? After 5 months of doing this, I felt that it\u0026rsquo;s still not enough to improve my skills, especially in the field of data science. Well, maybe after finishing all those courses we\u0026rsquo;ll get certificates. But unfortunately the certificate as a participant is not enough to show your capabilities, especially in front of potential employers. In my opinion, this is like passive learning where I only watch the videos, do a little bit hands on. It also creates the illusion of mastery, but finally I will quickly forget about them later. After considering these reasons, I decided not to continue with some unfinished courses and ended up looking for another data analytics tutorial that directly uses \u0026lsquo;real world fake data\u0026rsquo;. Learning by doing based on project method looks more efficient for me.\nHow did I start? I\u0026rsquo;m also confused at the moment, which step or tool should I choose firstly to focus in data science lessons? Is it Python, R, Tableau, or some other tool? But in the end I decided to learn Tableau first because I thought this tool looked easy and intuitive. Actually I was a little bit familiar with \u0026lsquo;Tableau\u0026rsquo; before graduating from college, but never used it for data analysis. I looked for one of the dashboard tutorials on Youtube for basic and chose this video to get started. The dataset used is still quite popular, namely about Covid-19 cases around the world. But I decided to specifically use the data of Indonesia Covid-19 case I obtained from Kaggle. Next, I started to learn how to make various charts and maps whose results can be seen here. Well, my first impression was:\nWow, how interesting! Maybe if it was designed even better it would look fancier and more attractive. After publishing my first Tableau dashboard ever, I became more and more interested in making dashboards with other datasets. The data I used on my second dashboard in Tableau Public is similar to the first dashboard, but the difference is that I used Covid-19 data from Germany and slightly changed the layout and colors. For those who are experts, maybe my dashboard design still looks ordinary. But to be honest I was quite impressed on my own design as beginner, and I realized that in Tableau we can make fancy and more beautiful designs to make the stories of data more attractive, as can be seen in the Tableau Public Gallery.\nExplore again, again, and again The next day, I tried again to make other dashboards using the data I got from the Kaggle site and explored some basic features. Yup, I\u0026rsquo;m the kind of person that when I become interested and enthusiastic about something, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to learn it again. Earthquakes History in Turkey (1924-2020) and Top 10 Amazon Most Book Reviewed (2009-2019) have became my third and fourth dashboard on Tableau Public. It feels like I\u0026rsquo;ve found something I love to do, and it certainly relates to my interests in design, backgrounds and my work.\nI realized, my knowledge is still less and I have to learn more. Because there are so many data visualization expert designers who are very talented and successful out there. They are my sources of inspiration!\nOkay, my story is actually still not over yet. I will update my next study journey about data visualization in Part 2.\nThanks for reading!\n","permalink":"https://gandesgold.com/blog/starting-dataviz-journey/","tags":["dataviz","Tableau"],"title":"Journey in #DataViz (Part 1)"},{"categories":["Thoughts"],"contents":"Sometimes relationship (romance or not) doesn\u0026rsquo;t always bring us happiness all the time. What is the meaning of this?\n● ● ●\n \u0026ldquo;When you blame and criticize others, you are avoiding some truth about yourself.\u0026quot; — Deepak Chopra\n As a human being I believe that each of us must has experienced problems with others, whether it\u0026rsquo;s with our parents, siblings, lovers, friends, and so on. And as humans, almost all of us must have felt irritated and blamed them in the end, right? Well, by writing this post actually it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that I want to be seen as a philosopher, wise person, or whatever it is. I only have intention to share with others about what I know and what I have learned before. Besides, this one is submitted as my own self-reminder too.\nI have close friends in my circle. Some of them sometimes told me the stories or problem, mostly about their love and friendship relationships. Often times, I also listen to them blaming the person who they are dealing with. Yes, blaming, judging. I thought this is normal for us to blame, as we are still human being anyway.\nBut, is this really true behaviour everytime? By the way, if you are one of my close friends who also read this, please don\u0026rsquo;t get offended firstly guys! I don\u0026rsquo;t have any intention to offend anyone actually. I feel the need to share this, so that we can learn and grow up together.\nAlright. Talking about blaming or judging, of course I have ever done this as well. Even I really did that frequently in the past, toward people or someone I loved. But lately I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking: Is this behaviour true? Am I really okay doing this? Will this really solve the problem, or not?\nIn recent months, I have been reading books and videos related to self-help. Thanks to pandemic, I get more times for reading books. I dug and dove about why people do what they do. Yes, I pretty wonder about this kind of topic. Also, it becomes one of my way to know truly about myself. Those books and videos generally have same explanation about the problem I was searching for: Why do we keep blaming others?\nBy the way, have you ever heard or feel familiar with this quote?\n \u0026ldquo;Your soulmate is your mirror.\u0026quot;\n Well, there is a life coach who I watch her videos on YouTube frequently, and she has ever talked about this topic. Her statements finally has made me thinking deeply and contemplating. Mainly, she said:\n \u0026ldquo;There are many people who think that our soulmate is our mirror. Yes, that\u0026rsquo;s true. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think those people really understand well about its meaning. They think, as mirror means their soulmate has same personality, same interests, or same behaviour. No, the meaning is not as simple as that actually.\nA true soulmate is a mirror. The person who shows you everything that is holding you back. The person who brings you to your attention so you can change your life.\u0026quot;\n Oh. My. God.\nBy knowing this, I realized that so far I have thought wrong about the meaning of soulmate too. I had kind of thought that soulmate must be people or someone who have same behaviour or interests as me. As simple as that. Okay, so silly I think. She also said, actually in this lifetime, we don\u0026rsquo;t have only one soulmate. Soulmate isn\u0026rsquo;t just for lovers. People who come into our life might be our soulmates too. They might keep staying or finally go from our life, and be our blessing or lessons.\nI suddenly remember about my high school friend in the past who has ever said:\n \u0026ldquo;A human is created to be an exam for the other humans.\u0026quot;\n Well, this sounded silly to me at that time. But in fact, yeah this is definitely true. Often times when we have problem with someone, we intend to blame them and play victim. For example we keep saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Why he/she cheated on me?\u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;I have given what he/she wants, but why he/she left me?\u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Why does he/she never understand me?\u0026quot;\nand blablabla~\nBut, do we actually ever think and introspect like,\n\u0026ldquo;Okay, she/he maybe did the mistake. But I may also have an issue without I realize, so that he/she acted that way to me.\u0026quot;\nor maybe,\n\u0026ldquo;Okay, she/he maybe has something they must deal with. That\u0026rsquo;s why they have acted that way.\u0026quot;\nYeah, it is easy for blaming others, because pointing and blaming ourselves is a painful thing for us! Honestly I regret since I have judged people much in the past, but at the same time I feel so lucky to be aware of this matter finally. I forgive myself and try to commit to solve the mistake by knowing myself more, because when we go inward, knowing ourselves truly, we will less judging others. Well, people who are dealing with us maybe don\u0026rsquo;t tell us explicitly which issues still keep staying in ourselves. But through our interaction with them, if we are aware, we will understand about our issues we should solve. For example, if someone likes to judge us, maybe we don\u0026rsquo;t realize that actually we like to judge people too. Or for another example, if someone disrespect us, maybe it is because of our lack of self-respect. This gives us a signal that we should start to learn how to love and respect ourselves. I think this is also true that people will see and treat us based on how we see and treat ourselves.\nSince I knew this one, slowly it changes my mindset to be more aware in interacting with people. It also trains me to be more empathetic. Every time I meet or have problem with them, I always think: What lesson must I learn from this? What issue in myself should I need to solve?\nReally, the way how you see people and deal with them will be better when you always have mindset like that. Trust me.\nTalking about relationship, mostly we directly think about romance things. Actually it is not about that only. Relationship can be the relation toward our friends, parents, teachers, colleagues, etc. But often times, we are triggered by romantic relationship more than the other relationship, for example like friendships. Like I said, we don\u0026rsquo;t have only one soulmate. The people who we have met and had deeper connection are actually maybe our soulmates, which help us to be more conscious about ourselves.\nDavid Richo, a psychotherapist once said in his book entitled Daring to Trust :\n \u0026ldquo;Intimate relationship bring up transferences more powerfully than friendships do. This is why friendships often work so much more easily than intimate relationships. They do not activate our early-life issues the way a primary relationship does. So they often remain relatively uncomplicated, mostly stress-free, unless more than friendship is afoot — namely, transference. At the same time, we may notice that the friends we most enjoy being with are the ones who create an atmosphere of cozy safety and security, and we appreciate the comfort in that.\u0026quot;\n I confirm that this is true and make sense, since I\u0026rsquo;ve been in this position. I have ever had experience in dealing with someone. When the conflict arises, I thought at that time I have been a stable person emotionally. But in fact I haven\u0026rsquo;t yet, and I tried to introspect myself after that. I realized that making a change is not an easy thing and it takes time, but I am sure it will be worth it in the end.\nI might have ever blamed people, but never regret to meet them. They have assisted me to make a better version of myself, after all. So, I am thankful to them who made I am today. In my opinion, we also need to understand about the essential meaning of having relationship. Do we have relationship to make us happy? No, I don\u0026rsquo;t think so. We should love and be happy with ourselves first, so that finally we can love others well and be happy. Relationship basically exists to help our souls grow. That is what I\u0026rsquo;ve learned.\nHow if those people always create the problem and never commit to make a change? Well, we only have two options: either we accept them, or we just leave. Stop thinking to change someone if we can\u0026rsquo;t tolerate them anymore, because we can\u0026rsquo;t control them anyway. Someone will change if they really want and have intention to do it for the sake of him/herself, not because of other reason. All we can do is to change ourselves. Yes, focus on ourselves is the key. If they are not right for us, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s time to let them go and move on. Easier said than done, but what else can we do? Sometimes problems get more complicated just because of us, who don\u0026rsquo;t know how to face and solve it simply.\nHaving a relationship is not easy as it seems, maybe. But after all, this is a really good thing for us to practice our self consciousness.\nThanks for reading.\n","permalink":"https://gandesgold.com/blog/conscious-relationship/","tags":["relationship","self awareness"],"title":"Relationship Doesn't Mean to Make Us Happy, But It Makes Us Conscious"},{"categories":["Tips/Tutorial"],"contents":"My learning documentation for a tutorial about web scraping/data extraction using some libraries in Python\n● ● ●\nToday for spending time on weekend, I decided to learn about Web Scraping in Python. Web scraping/web data extraction/web harvesting is a technique to extract the necessary content or data from a website. This method is really powerful especially in business and market research, such as product and price optimization, competitor monitoring, etc.\nIs web scraping legal? Based on my research from some sources, it depends. If our intention is for educational purpose and as long as it is the public domain data, there is no strict implication so far. But it becomes illegal when you against the websites\u0026rsquo;s Terms and Conditions, and downloading data at too rapid a rate because this may break the website. For more complete reasons, you can visit and read here.\nThe data I used for this simple web scraping learning is Countries of the World, which is collected from https://scrapethissite.com/. I use Python 3.7 with PyCharm as the IDE software. I intentionally decided to learn the simple one for now, because it is necessary to understand the alghorithm firstly. The data I want to extract from this dataset are : name of country, its capital, population, and area.\n  Countries of World   For web scraping, actually there are many popular Python libraries like Scrapy, Beautiful Soup, lxml, Selenium, etc. But for this learning I only used :\n BeautifulSoup : A parsing library that can use different parsers. A parser is simply a program that can extract data from HTML and XML documents. requests : A vital and powerful HTTP library. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t help us only to get the raw ingredients (i.e. HTML), but also can access the API’s, post to forms, etc. pandas : A powerful package for data manipulation. We need it later to build the DataFrame of scraping result.  As web scraping is extracting data from HTML/XML, we should have some knowledge about HTML/JS/CSS as pre-requisite so that we can do it much easier.\nThe first step, as usual we need to install and import the libraries of course. We can install the Python libraries/packages in some ways. Because I use Pycharm, I want to install the packages in PyCharm directly, and you can see the steps here. After installed, import them all by writing syntax:\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup import requests import pandas as pd Next, make a \u0026lsquo;list\u0026rsquo; to save the scraping result and pull down the content of the page by using the libraries\ndata = [] # make a list page = requests.get('https://scrapethissite.com/pages/simple/') soup = BeautifulSoup(page.content, 'html.parser') Well, now it\u0026rsquo;s time to start to pull the content through HTML by using inspect element. Right-click the mouse and choose Inspect in Google Chrome, and it will show like this :\n  Inspect Element   Here, I want to get the all contents of each country. If we inspect the elements of each country, we can know that the HTML tag they use is same: \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;col-md-4 country\u0026quot;\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\n  Inspect Element Countries   So, we can use that HTML tag for scraping the each country by writing syntax:\ncountry = soup.find_all('div', class_='col-md-4 country') If we see the detail of \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;col-md-4 country\u0026quot;\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;, we can find the other HTML tags to save the name of country, capital of country, population, and area.\nThis is the example of HTML code of one country :\n  Data of Countries   Now we understand that :\n For each name of country is located in \u0026lt;h3\u0026gt; tag with the class named 'country-name' For each name of capital is located in \u0026lt;span\u0026gt; tag with the class named 'country-capital' For each population of country is located in \u0026lt;span\u0026gt; tag with the class named 'country-population' For each area of country is located in \u0026lt;span\u0026gt; tag with the class named 'country-area'  Next, let put the HTML tags above to syntax :\nfor c in country: country = c.find('h3', class_='country-name').text capital = c.find('span', class_='country-capital').text population = c.find('span', class_='country-population').text area = c.find('span', class_='country-area').text If you see the codes above, there are functions called findand find_all. Both of them are the example of BeautifulSoup functions, which are used to extract data from HTML. find is used to extract only one output, so if we want to extract more than one output then we can use find_all function.\nFor the next step, use append function to take the country, capital, population, and area into list that we have made before.\n data.append({ 'Country': country, 'Capital': capital, 'Population': population, 'Area': area }) Then, after the iteration finished, convert the list to be DataFrame using pandas library and save it to csv file. Run all syntax and wait for the process.\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data) df.to_csv('country.csv', index=False, encoding=\u0026quot;utf-8\u0026quot;) Finally! Check the csv file result, and it will shows like this one :\n  CSV result   For the complete code and csv file result, you can see or download them through my simple web scraping repository on Github.\n","permalink":"https://gandesgold.com/blog/simple-webscraping/","tags":["python","web scraping"],"title":"A Simple Web Scraping with Python"},{"categories":["Tips/Tutorial"],"contents":"My learning documentation about making word cloud as one of chart for data visualization in R\n● ● ●\nLast year, in July 2019 I attended a Data Science workshop which was provided by Indonesia Financial Authority (OJK). The lesson materials they provided are basic and good enough. One of them is about making a word cloud visualization from text datasets with R, which is example of text mining implementation. This one is an interesting part to me. To be honest, I little bit forgot about this material, so today I want to learn and remember it again and make its learning documentation. Beside of sharing, this documentation may be useful to me as reminder if I forget about the algorithm, libraries/packages, etc later.\nBased on research of Yuping Jin, the basic layout algorithm in generating a word cloud is to estimate the frequency level of a keyword by their frequencies or categories. In principle, the font size of a word in the word cloud is determined by its appearing frequency. You can read the paper for more detail here.\nThe dataset used for generating word cloud is finance.csv. It consists of collection of people\u0026rsquo;s comments about topic related to financial in Indonesian language.\nFor this learning, these are some R libraries we need to make a word cloud visualization:\n  tm : A Text Mining package which provides some powerful functions in text-processing steps and has methods such as importing data, handling corpus, metadata management, creation of term document matrices, and preprocessing methods.\n  SnowballC : An R interface to the C \u0026lsquo;libstemmer\u0026rsquo; library that implements Porter\u0026rsquo;s word stemming algorithm for collapsing words to a common root to aid comparison of vocabulary.\n  wordcloud : A package which has functionality to create pretty word clouds, visualize differences and similarity between documents, and avoid over-plotting in scatter plots with text.\n  RColorBrewer : This package provides color schemes for maps (and other graphics) designed by Cynthia Brewer as described at http://colorbrewer2.org\n  For initial step, Open RStudio and install the libraries above and load them by writing syntax:\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;tm\u0026quot;) install.packages(\u0026quot;SnowballC\u0026quot;) install.packages(\u0026quot;wordcloud\u0026quot;) install.packages(\u0026quot;RColorBrewer\u0026quot;) library(\u0026quot;tm\u0026quot;) library(\u0026quot;SnowballC\u0026quot;) library(\u0026quot;wordcloud\u0026quot;) library(\u0026quot;RColorBrewer\u0026quot;) Then, determine the file directory path where we save the document, and read the dataset text.\n#Set the directory file setwd(\u0026quot;/Users/gandes.goldestan/Downloads/wordcloud\u0026quot;) #Read the dataset berita \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026quot;finance.csv\u0026quot;, header = TRUE,sep=\u0026quot;;\u0026quot;) View(berita) After that, we need to make Corpus. Corpus is the collection of written texts. In this project, I put the value for the maximum printed up to 5000 rows. Actually we can set the number to any value, and it doesn’t matter.\ndocs \u0026lt;- Corpus(VectorSource(berita[1:5000,1])) inspect(docs) The next step we do is transforming the texts with tm_map function. For example, we will replace \u0026quot;/\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;@\u0026quot;, and \u0026quot;|\u0026quot; with spaces.\ntoSpace \u0026lt;- content_transformer(function(x, pattern) gsub(pattern, \u0026quot; \u0026quot;,x)) docs \u0026lt;- tm_map(docs, toSpace, \u0026quot;/\u0026quot;) docs \u0026lt;- tm_map(docs, toSpace, \u0026quot;@\u0026quot;) docs \u0026lt;- tm_map(docs, toSpace, \u0026quot;\\\\|\u0026quot;) docs \u0026lt;- tm_map(docs, toSpace, \u0026quot;https\u0026quot;) docs \u0026lt;- tm_map(docs, toSpace, \u0026quot;com\u0026quot;) We will continue to convert the texts to lowercase, remove the numbers, remove punctuations, eliminates excessive white space, and remove stopwords.\nStopwords are words which does not add much meaning to a sentence. They can safely be ignored without sacrificing the meaning of the sentence. Because the texts dataset we used are in Indonesian, so we also use stopwords text file in Indonesian.\n#Transform text to lowercase docs \u0026lt;- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower)) #Remove the numbers docs \u0026lt;- tm_map(docs, removeNumbers) #Remove stopwords with \u0026quot;stopwords_id.txt\u0026quot; stopwords_id \u0026lt;- readLines(file.choose()) typeof(stopwords_id) docs \u0026lt;- tm_map(docs, removeWords, stopwords_id) #Remove punctuations docs \u0026lt;- tm_map(docs, removePunctuation) #Eliminate excessive white spaces docs \u0026lt;- tm_map(docs, stripWhitespace) After the document is prepared, we continue to create a Term-Document Matrix. Based on DisplayR :\n \u0026ldquo;A term document matrix is a way of representing the words in the text as a table (or matrix) of numbers. The rows of the matrix represent the text responses to be analysed, and the columns of the matrix represent the words from the text that are to be used in the analysis.\u0026quot;\n A term-document matrix is an important representation for text analytics.\ndtm \u0026lt;- TermDocumentMatrix(docs) m \u0026lt;- as.matrix(dtm) v \u0026lt;- sort(rowSums(m), decreasing = TRUE) d \u0026lt;- data.frame(word = names(v), freq = v) head(d, 15) Run the syntax above, and the matrix result will be shown like this:\n  Term-Document Matrix   Next, call the Word Cloud visualization by writing the syntax:\nset.seed(12) windows() wordcloud(words=d$word, freq = d$freq, min.freq = 100, max.words = 100, random.order = FALSE, rot.per = 0.35, colors = brewer.pal(8, \u0026quot;Dark2\u0026quot;)) Each parameter is explained below:\n words = the words to be plotted freq = the frequency of each word min.freq = words with a frequency below min.freq will not be plotted max.words = the maximum number of words to be plotted random.order = plotting words in random order, otherwise FALSE rot.per = proportion of words with 90 degree rotation (vertical text) colors = word color from the least frequent to the most frequent  Now, it shows the visualization of Word Cloud like an image below.\n  Word Cloud Visualization   From the word cloud above we can see the top 3 of most frequent words are \u0026ldquo;bank\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;twitter\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;pemerintah\u0026rdquo;.\nWe also can make a visualization of most frequent words in a bar graph using this syntax:\nwindows() barplot(d[1:10,]$freq, las=2, names.arg = d[1:10,]$word, col = \u0026quot;lightblue\u0026quot;, main=\u0026quot;Most frequent words\u0026quot;, ylab = \u0026quot;word frequencies\u0026quot;) Then, this is the output we get:\n  Most Frequent Words   For the example of implementation, world cloud is one of interesting way to visualize about trending words/topic in social media and creating tags/categories in website. But, the weakness is we need to make time to clean up the data before processing and visualizing it so that we need the accurate result.\nFor the complete code and dataset, you can download or see them in my GitHub wordcloud repository.\n","permalink":"https://gandesgold.com/blog/wordcloud-with-r/","tags":["R"],"title":"How to Create Wordcloud Visualization with R"},{"categories":["Thoughts"],"contents":"My opinion about side project, whether we should do it or not for our skill development\n● ● ●\nHi again, folks!\nIn my previous blog post I have written about my experience and benefits I got from having a bookstagram account. After launched my bookstagram, I promoted it to my friends firstly, including my work colleagues. One of them was even saying, “Wow, this is great! I like seeing people who have side project to do.”\nOh, \u0026ldquo;side project\u0026rdquo;?\nWell, actually ‘side project’ are common words. But I don’t know why, it feels like this word caught my attention suddenly. I got interested to search for its definition in Google, and I found its meaning from one of Forbes articles. It says:\n “Side project is a venture of any kind, which is separate to your main line of work. This could be the decision to start a new business, begin an MBA, sit on a board or committee, become a non-exec director, write a novel or even begin investing. It’s anything that changes how you spend your time or adds another line to your bio.”\n Oh okay, I understand now. So, managing a bookstagram can be included into side project I think. Then I was curious again, what is the importance of having side project? Side project could even reduce our times and spend our money sometimes, right? But each thing must have positive and negative sides. Let’s focus on the positives and here what I’ve found:\nSide project is fun thing Yes, side project should be something that we truly enjoy, and in other side it help us to practice a marketable skilll. If it doesn’t help you to practice a marketable skill, then we are just having fun. Yeah, make sense enough. Besides, having side project we enjoy can refresh us from our stressful main work, which is really important to our mental health. It allows us to work without any constraints, no deadlines and specifications, where we can decide our schedule, pace of work and priorities. Okay, so now let’s think about something we are passionate, find its hidden skill lesson to gain, and let’s get started!\nThey boost our skills and knowledge This is what I really love about having side project! In here, I am allowed to explore and learn new things that my daily work might not. For example, I have reading activity as one of my hobbies, and then I established a bookstagram account. Surely, it helps me to learn new techniques and improve my current skills in using editing softwares, designing templates, and managing social media. To me, the best learning method is directly getting down and participating in the subject itself to gain self-confidence and grow. To me, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if my side project still doesn\u0026rsquo;t pay me now. I am sure many people were in this position. But I believe, the more skills I gain through this, I will pick the benefits later.\nDoing side project(s) has benefit for career Well, I can’t deny that this one is also my strong motivation to continue doing side project: to add my portfolios. It says, the chances of getting a job increases if we can show a variety personal works which is interesting, real, and meaningful rather than a simple resume only. This is one of reasons why these days I am addicted to learning about data science skills. Besides, if we have great and meaningful side projects, it could be our main job later. I ever read from an article from Inc.com, it is written that many big companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc has long encouraged its employees to devote 20 percent of their time to side projects, which is one reason why it remains one of the most innovative companies in the world. Do you know that even their products like Gmail, Google Maps, Twitter, Slack, etc all started as side projects? What incredible outcomes!\nIt teaches me about time management By doing side project, I must know when I have to stay away from my regular work or my side project so that I keep having a balanced life. To be more creative and productive we should have enough rest too. To be remember: we are still human, not robot!\nAfter I know fully the importances of side project above, really I felt so damn regret. Why hadn’t I started to have my side projects since a long time ago? I wish I could have done it earlier! But okay anyway, regret is a useless thing. I learnt my mistakes and I accept it. Now, the most important thing is I finally know what I must do to accelerate my skills and experience and then be consistent about it.\nI hope this article gives benefit not only to me, but the others too. I always remind myself every time: Don’t be lazy to learn. Learn and learn from everything, every time!\nA Greek philosopher, Socrates said:\n “Knowing that you know nothing makes you the smartest of all.”\n Thanks for reading.\nKeep hustling, being productive, and have a nice day!\n","permalink":"https://gandesgold.com/blog/side-project-benefit/","tags":["side project"],"title":"Having Side Project? Why Not?"},{"categories":["Thoughts"],"contents":"The story of my wonderful experience and benefits I get from managing bookstagram with a friend in pandemic times\n● ● ●\nOne day a friend who is also my work colleague chatted me suddenly. She told me that she just bought a Kindle like mine from an online marketplace. Yeah Kindle, an e-reader device that is usually used by people to read e-books. She said she was thinking to buy it because she doesn’t know what to do to spend her leisure time in this Corona pandemic. She needs to do something productive, so she decided to get a Kindle. Good then I think, because not all people are interested in spending their money to buy a special device which has only benefit to read e-books. Especially in country like Indonesia, we can say it’s still rare enough.\nA few days later my friend contacted me again. She said she has an idea:\n \u0026ldquo;How about we create a special Instagram account to share the review of books (and e-books) we have read? Like a bookstagram account! I think this is a good thing we do to share reviews of good books we’ve read to people, so they may be also encouraged to read books more like us. Right?\u0026quot;\n Wow, yeah this idea sounds exciting I think! Literacy rate is still low in my country, unfortunately. There are still many people who don’t get interested in reading and writing. Our bookstagram should has good mission for this matter. Make sense enough. Actually I had ever thought to create my own bookstagram before, but I was too lazy to make contents regularly with fancy instagram-able photos. At that time my desire to read books is less than now, even I opened my own Kindle just once a month. Then I finally agreed to her idea, because this pandemic has made me keep staying at home due to lockdown almost in all places and this situation makes me getting bored day by day. So, I think by reading many books and managing a bookstagram outside of work time could make me being more productive again.\nAt the same day finally we searched for our unique bookstagram name, made its account, and discussed about what kind of contents we’re gonna share. Finally we chose @braincorners as our bookstagram name because it hadn’t been existed on Instagram. We decided to make three kinds of content for initial: book review, quote of the book, and lesson learned from the book itself.\nAfter a few weeks since we started to make and upload the bookstagram contents, from my own self it feels like I get many positive impacts already from this managing bookstagram activity:\nIt keeps me motivated to read books more Having a bookstagram, it means we need to prepare the contents to share to our followers. And the source of contents are from the books we have read, of course. Indirectly, it motivates me to read books more so that I can keep sharing the review contents. I set my reading schedule at least one hour per day, whether in leisure time, after finishing my work, or even before sleeping at night. Well, actually it also doesn’t mean that I read a book for the sake of making content only. Anyway, reading more books is really positive thing to get new knowledge, right?\nBookstagram is similar like a note and self reminder tools Mostly the books we review come from non-fiction such as personal development/mindfulness/psychology genre. For this one luckily we have similar book taste. My friend is interested in self help books, and me too I like reading something which is related to psychology, mental health, and spiritual. Quite similar, right? I think as we are still young, we need to learn more from other people or author’s experiences about how we can do things in life with less suffering. Yeah, life is about learning and challenge. That’s why we also added the words Longlife Learner’s Corner as @braincorners’ profile tagline. For me, bookstagram is one of the best place for us to save some inspirational book key takeaways as note and it can be self reminder. Sometimes when I feel difficult in a situation, I open @braincorners and read them again to keep myself motivated. I hope our contents really give benefits not only for me, but for the others too.\nI totally agree with a quote by Lauren Fleshman:\n \u0026ldquo;By lifting each other up, we lift ourselves up.\u0026quot;\n My english skill is progressively improved If you visit our bookstagram, you can see all of our books and contents are written in English. Yes, we decided to use only English so that it is not only Indonesian people who can understand our contents but also people who come from other countries. It doesn’t mean that we don’t love to use our native language. In my opinion, we shouldn’t limit ourselves in sharing with others. By reading, indirectly it increases my English vocabularies. Well, my partner has better English skill than me. When we try to make review, lesson learned, or caption draft contents, I often observe and learn from her how to arrange good English word sentences. By doing this way, I feel its difference that my english has been more improved than before. For those who want to improve English skill, I think this is worth to try!\nSome soft skills are developed Managing this bookstagram honestly feels like managing a small organization. Often times when both of us discuss about contents and design, we might have a little arguments. But it is normal thing that can happen I think, because we are different human with different mind basically. Fortunately, we are able to compromise and understand each other about our expectation. We learn how to respect each other’s opinion and empathy. Well, these should be significant skills and behaviour we must have, right?\nIt makes me to be a more creative person Making good content is a significant part that we must do when we have a public Instagram account. Eventhough @braincorners is still small, we are committed to keep sharing good quality contents. We learn how to take photos with good angle and properties, use design graphic software to edit the contents, browse about fancy and inspirational template design, learn how to pick efficient hashtags, etc. So far, I enjoy doing this one because I also have interest in digital design. Also, managing social media is one of demand skills nowadays. Again finally, one more hard skill to be content creator is getting improved!\nSharing knowledge is happiness Sometimes we also get positive feedbacks from our followers through direct messages, comments, or likes about contents we have shared. “Thank you for the good content, it is inspiring. Keep sharing!”, those kind of words are mood booster, really. It feels really good when there are people who still appreciate us about what we do. We become to be motivated more and more for sharing knowledge through incredible contents, and it is also my best kind of happiness.\nYes, that’s all the benefits I have got from managing bookstagram so far. I can say, lucky me to meet a partner who has the same hobby and then we can do something positive like this. I hope we can continue to keep sharing the knowledge we get and inspire other people.\nThanks for reading.\n","permalink":"https://gandesgold.com/blog/bookstagram-benefit/","tags":["bookstagram","kindle","book","hobby"],"title":"Benefits I Get from Managing a Bookstagram"}]
